/*
  There may be prettier ways to do this, but this is reliable:
    - Force entire page to 100% width and height with no padding
    - Include a container to center the canvas
    - Include a second container to force aspect ratio
    - Set canvas to width and height 100%

  This setup ensures that asking the canvas what size it is (client width and height)
  returns the actual number of pixels it is.
